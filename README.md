### 💻  About Me :

I am a first-year student at Columbia University majoring in Computer Science!
- 🖱️ My newfound passion for designing applications, programming and problem solving has led me to study CS, particularly through java and R. Although I began with a more humanities-oriented background, I hope to integrate my artistic passions with these technical skills through creative computing and user/website design.

- 📖 Currently, I am taking Data Structures and Discrete Mathematics, with a plan to learn Advanced Programming in C and C++ and Competitive Programming in sophomore year.
- 🎨 In my free time, I love to paint and create designs.
